        <h1>General information</h1>

        <p>The Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) initiates, promotes and co-ordinates a wide range of
            scientific research programmes in Antarctica, many of which involve significant international collaboration.
            The SCAR Standing Committee on Antarctic Geographic Information (SC-AGI) co-ordinates the provision of a
            geographic reference for scientific activities in Antarctica and the dissemination of Antarctic geographic
            information.
            The SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica is an activity conducted in this framework.</p>

        <p>In 1992 the SCAR Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information (WG-GGI), during the XXII SCAR meeting
            in Bariloche, recognized the need for a composite gazetteer of Antarctica to bring some order to the complex
            toponymy of Antarctica. The goal of the work programme which evolved from that discussion was to provide the
            scientific community with two products:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a compilation of all existing geographic names of Antarctica and</li>
            <li>a set of guidelines to be followed when proposing new names and when selecting one name from a list of
                synonyms for a given feature.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Because Antarctica does not fall under the sovereignty of any one nation this particular continent is
            similar, in many respects, to the oceans. In general every country has a recognized body which approves the
            names of geographic features in the country and also has the power to enforce their use. For Antarctica,
            however, there is no such single naming authority. Individual countries are responsible for their national
            policy on, and authorisation and use of, Antarctic names.</p>

        <p>The case of the oceans is however somewhat different because, by an agreement between two international
            institutions - the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic
            Commission (IOC) - it has been possible to establish a unique set of names for under-sea features depicted
            on the <a href="https://www.gebco.net">General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO)</a>.</p>

        <p>The GEBCO Sub-Committee on Undersea Feature Names (SCUFN) maintains and makes available a <a
                href="https://www.gebco.net/data-products/undersea-feature-names">digital gazetteer</a> of the names,
            generic feature type and geographic position of features on the seafloor.</p>

        <p>During 2019-2021 SCAGI prepared a document titled International Principles and Procedures for Antarctic Place
            Names which was published in October 2021 as SCAR Report 41. It recommended international principles and
            procedures for the use of existing place names and the standardization of new names for features in
            Antarctica (south of 60Â°S). The SCAR, through its recommendations, expresses the hope that the present
            effort will contribute to the adoption in Antarctica of the general principle of 'one name per feature' by
            all Antarctic place naming authorities.</p>

        <p>To support the principles and procedures, SCAGI compiled a <a
                href="https://scar.org/~documents/route%3A/download/5727">reference list</a> of national Antarctic
            place-naming authorities, documents and gazetteers.</p>

        <p>To assist with the process of proposing a name for an Antarctic feature, SCAGI has developed an <a
                href="https://scar.org/~documents/route%3A/download/5728">Antarctic Place Name Proposal Form</a>.</p>
