			<h4>2. HISTORY OF THE WORK PROGRAMME<a name="2"></a></h4>
<h4>2A. The first two years, 1992-1994<a name="2a"></a></h4>
<p>At the XXII SCAR Meeting in 1992, Italy was tasked with compiling a composite 	gazetteer of Antarctica.</p>
<p>At the same time the preparation of the guidelines for the correct choice 	of the names (toponymic guidelines) was assigned to Germany.</p>
<p>The two countries were referred to as the Convenors of the programme &quot;Place 	names&quot;, a programme promoted by the Working Group of the SCAR known as GGI (Geodesy 	and Geographic Information). The long-term objectives of the programme were &quot;to develop a composite gazetteer containing all names adopted by all countries&quot; and &quot;to develop a proposal for guidelines for naming Antarctic features&quot;. The Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica (CGA) is the result of a fourteen-year 	commitment by Italy, under the sponsorship of the Italian Antarctic Programme 	(PNRA) and with the co-operation of many other countries.</p>
<p>The membership of the SCAR WG-GGI changed during the years. The final 	membership at the date in which the WG-GGI was abolished and incorporated in 	the new SCAR organization is given in Annex A .</p>
<p>During the period 1992-94, between XXII and XXIII SCAR, Italy set up an 	ad hoc group of specialists (Annex B) to undertake the work. It soon became 	evident that a database approach was necessary, due to the huge amounts of toponymic 	data to be handled. DBASE IV software was selected	because of its use world-wide.<br />
Italy began collating existing lists of geographic names (gazetteers) issued 	by several countries and asking other countries within SCAR to make their lists 	available, if any existed. All countries adhering to SCAR, i.e. Full Members 	and Associate Members, were requested to contribute data. The countries having 	an official member in the WG-GGI were contacted through their WG member (by 	the Italian member of the WG-GGI). Those countries which did not have a member 	in the WG-GGI were addressed through their SCAR Permanent	Delegate.</p>
<p>Several nations sent their Antarctic gazetteers to Italy. When the gazetteer 	was already available in printed form, either as a single edition or as a first 	edition plus addenda, the published document(s) were taken as the equivalent 	of an official communication. Other gazetteers were supplied to Italy indirectly 	by Australia, which had made a preliminary collection of Antarctic toponyms 	prior to 1992 (courtesy of Brian Murphy).</p>
<p>Content and format of the original lists of names were not homogeneous. 	The approach chosen by the different countries varied and it was necessary to 	examine and discuss the data before adopting a suitable unifying format. When 	the &quot;ad hoc&quot; group in Italy began reassembling all available data into a single database, 	several incongruities, mis-spellings and obscure points became apparent. Some 	of them were discovered when looking at a single national gazetteer, others 	when comparing two or more gazetteers.</p>
<h4>2B. Development between 1994 and 1996<a name="2b"></a></h4>
<p>A first draft of the Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica was presented and 	discussed at the WG-GGI meeting in 1994, held in conjunction with the XXIII 	SCAR in Rome. The WG-GGI members were requested to revise, as soon as possible 	after the meeting, the list of their nationally approved names included in the 	CGA, as these had been modified slightly to comply with the selected CGA format. 	In addition, members were requested to answer a list of questions arising from 	the assembling procedure and analysis of the gazetteers performed by Italy. 	Last but not least, the WG-GGI members were requested to authorize the data, 	i.e. to acknowledge that the data in the draft composite gazetteer had been, 	to the best of their knowledge, officially approved by their country. It was 	considered both impractical and formally incorrect by the Convenor of the project 	to have a direct contact with the national authorities for Antarctic Place-names 	(national names	committee, geographic board, Antarctic institute or geographic naming authority of 	each country, Annex C) because of the lack of a deep knowledge of the international organizations.</p>
<p>Between XXIII SCAR and the following WG-GGI meeting at XXIV SCAR in Cambridge 	in 1996, the work proceeded along much the same lines as in the past: new countries 	sent their national lists of names and some countries helped to solve ambiguous 	issues and to amend mis-spellings or misprints.</p>
<h4>2C. Work between 1996 and 1998<a name="2c"></a></h4>
<p>At the WG-GGI meeting in 1996, held in Cambridge jointly with the XXIV 	SCAR, a preliminary version of the combined list of names was tabled by Italy. 	A new request for receiving additional lists of names and for obtaining the 	authorization and validation of existing data was also addressed to each country. 	It was agreed that the next objective should be to publish the Composite Gazetteer 	of Antarctica in time for the XXV SCAR in 1998. Italy, continuing as the Convenor 	of the project, would endeavour to make the CGA as comprehensive and accurate 	as possible. The SCAR general policy about geographic names was issued as Recommendation 	SCAR XXIV-5 (see Annex	D).</p>
<p>The WG-GGI discussion held in Cambridge in 1996 made it clear that the 	following additional information should be incorporated in a future edition 	of the CGA</p>
<ul>
    <li>a short description of the feature, because in most cases a name 		without a description would not identify the feature unambiguously;	and</li>
    <li>the date of approval of a name.</li>
</ul>
<p>The new goals for the Italian team were thus to validate existing entries, 	incorporate additional gazetteers, extend the structure of the database to include 	date of approval and a descriptive field, develop a web site with search facilities, 	and publish the CGA as a SCAR publication.</p>
<p>However, the SCAR WG-GGI Executive meeting, held in Washington one year 	later (27-28 August 1997), amended those objectives to ensure that an accurate 	interim, abridged product containing name, geographical co-ordinates, and a 	country three-letter code (i.e. the ISO code identifying the country which provides 	the name) could be available by XXV SCAR in July 1998. A special workshop held 	in Cambridge (7-9 October 1997) finalised the input from the WG-GGI Executive 	meeting of Washington.</p>
<p>A letter from the Convenor of the programme was sent to all WG-GGI members 	(23 December 1996) reminding contributors of the need to validate their national 	entries in the list and indicating that the deadline for the receipt of corrections/additional 	lists of names would be the end of July 1997. The deadline would ensure that 	the task force in Italy could have sufficient time to complete the assembling 	and editing of the list for the publication at XXV SCAR in Concepci&oacute;n, 1998. 	Another letter followed on 8 May 1997, reminding members that the deadline was 	approaching.</p>
<p>Although the deadline had expired, on 7 November 1997 the SCAR Executive 	Secretary Peter Clarkson addressed a final call to the Permanent Delegates of 	those countries which had not responded earlier, giving them a last opportunity 	to send their contributions to Italy. All data received by the Convenor by 30 	November 1997 were thus incorporated in the CGA.</p>
<p>The printed version of the CGA (SCAR - Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica 	/ South of latitude 60&deg; S - Working Group on Geodesy and Geographic Information, 	March 1998, Vol. 1, 227 pages; Vol. 2, 328 pages; 250 copies) was issued with 	the financial support of SCAR. It was distributed at the meeting in Concepci&oacute;n 	(or soon after) to the SCAR Permanent Delegates, to the MNAPs and to the WG-GGI 	members.</p>
<p>At the meeting in Concepci&oacute;n Italy was also requested to keep up with 	the responsibility of maintaining the CGA.</p>
<p>The SCAR general policy about geographic names was stated anew as the 	SCAR Recommendation XXV-7 (see Annex D).</p>
<h4>2D. Work between 1998 and 2000<a name="2d"></a></h4>
<p>In the years 1998 to 2000 the Italian team entrusted with the compilation 	of geographical names of Antarctica prepared two contributions to the first 	edition (March 1998) of the SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica (CGA). Both 	contributions were presented and discussed at Tokyo meeting, July 2000. At the 	same time the Italian team was keeping up with the collection of new geographic 	names.</p>
<p>The first of the contributions to the CGA is a paper entitled &quot;Supplement 	to the first edition of the CGA&quot;. It contained all the addenda or amendments necessary to update the previous 	edition of the CGA. The Supplement was meant to be kept by the users beside 	the Volume 1 and Volume 2 of the CGA and consulted jointly.</p>
<p>The second contribution is a draft, preliminary and also partial, of a 	possible future second edition of Volume 2 of the CGA. The rationale of this 	effort is the following. Since the time of the first publication, i.e. March 	1998, it was recognized that the SCAR CGA should incorporate, for each name 	in the list, the description of the feature and the date of approval of the 	name. This additional information, which is not always present in national gazetteers, 	is necessary in our case to allow the development of the future work of comparison 	and, possibly, choice of the names. Following the discussions in Concepti&oacute;n, 	further refined in a meeting in Rome (March 1999) and a subsequent meeting in 	Heppenheim (July 1999), all countries were requested to supply such an additional 	information. The effort required from the nations was however limited, at that 	stage, to names beginning	with letter &quot;A&quot; only.</p>
<p>The second contribution to the CGA, circulated at Tokyo meeting, was nothing 	more than a good example, suitable for the discussion, of what the new SCAR 	CGA, completed with descriptions and dates of approval, would look like. Actually 	not all requested nations responded in time and only the first letter of the 	alphabet was taken into consideration. However most editorial aspects, such 	as the format of the printed issue and the necessary computer routines, were 	set up.</p>
<p>In the years 1998 to 2000, 773 new place names have been approved by national 	naming authorities and submitted for the inclusion in the CGA. The new names 	in the Supplement were contributed by Australia (4), Germany (6), Ecuador (9), 	Great Britain (56), New Zealand (193), Poland (87) and USA (418). They are all 	listed in the Supplement.</p>
<p>Starting from August 1998 Italy maintains the CGA web site www3.pnra.it/SCAR_GAZE 	and updates it quarterly: 1st January, 1st April, 1st June, 1st September. The 	site, in English and Italian, contains the database of geographical names plus 	some searching facilities.</p>
<h4>2E. From 2000 to 2002<a name="2e"></a></h4>
<p>At the XXVI SCAR Meeting in Tokyo the process of restructuring SCAR's 	strategy and procedures was well underway and it became rather clear that the 	structure of SCAR, including the existing Working Groups and in particular the 	WG-GGI (on Geodesy and Geographic Information), was about to undergo a major 	change. Nevertheless the work on the CGA progressed along	the usual lines.</p>
<p>A paper appeared on the SCAR Bulletin described the structure of the CGA 	and the status of the database. (A composite gazetteer of Antarctica; R.Cervellati, 	M.C.Ramorino, Jorn Sievers, Janet Thomson, Drew Clarke; SCAR Bulletin no.138, 	July 2000). There were at that time 21,552 names corresponding	to 16,563 features.</p>
<h4>2F. From 2002 to 2004<a name="2f"></a></h4>
<p>The new structure of the SCAR became official during the XXVII SCAR Meeting 	(July 2002) in Shanghai. The existing Working Groups were disbanded and most 	of the previous members flowed into three newly formed Standing Scientific Groups. 	As to the WG-GGI, its members mostly converged into the Geoscience Standing 	Scientific Group (GSSG) jointly with members coming from other WGs specialised 	in similar but different disciplines. The activities of the SSG were grouped 	into minor groups with different characteristics and goals such as Action Groups 	and Expert Groups. An Expert Group was formed with the purpose of dealing with 	the Geospatial Information (GIG). The activities	on the CGA became part of GIG.</p>
<p>The change of structure was not beneficial for the progress of the CGA 	because it was not clear anymore who was the official country's representative 	for the matters concerning the geographical names. Despite that, the work on 	the CGA progressed steadily due to the personal commitment of the same persons 	who were active in this field before.</p>
<p>A restrict meeting on the Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica was held concurrently 	with a workshop on the Antarctic GIS in Freiburg in April 2003. Progress of 	the Project, problems and trends were discussed. Janet Thomson (UK), who had 	been particularly active in the development of the CGA since its very beginning, 	attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The collection of new names and descriptions continued and the results 	were summarised in a new addendum to the CGA. For sake of simplicity it was 	decided that the new addendum should fully incorporate the previous one (edited 	August 2000) thus easing the task of the reader who would find all data collected 	after March 1998 in a single publication. Accordingly	the new publication, &quot;SCAR - Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica - Geoscience Standing Scientific Group 	- Supplement July 2004&quot; makes the previous Supplement obsolete and offers, together with the original 	publication issued in March 1998, a complete overview of the data till that 	time.</p>
<p>The Supplement contains two main sections which are the straightforward 	updating, to the date of July 2004, of the CGA. The sections retain the structure 	and all the relevant characteristics of the previous two Volumes. That holds 	in particular for geographic coverage, synonyms, transliterations, diacritical 	marks, alphabetical order, country sources, feature classes	and reference numbers.</p>
<p>In the Supplement, the section &quot;Addendum 	to Vol.1&quot; lists: names not existing in the first edition, names with modified coordinates, 	names to be associated to a different reference number, names with modified 	spelling or modified geographical class. All together there are 2970 names.</p>
<p>The second section of the Supplement, &quot;Addendum 	to Vol. 2&quot;, comes as the straightforward consequence of the matter contained in the first 	section. One should keep in mind that Volume 2 of the CGA is just a different 	arrangement of the main database. In Volume 2 all the existing geographical 	features have been listed according to the reference number, each record in 	Volume 2 grouping all applicable names to a given feature. Analogously, the 	second section of the Supplement is a list of features and it puts together 	all the applicable names (the list being restricted however to the matter considered 	in the first section of the Supplement).</p>
<p>The Supplement July 2004 has been also endowed with separate lists	for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>all Antarctic Stations (summer only and full year), taken from the 		COMNAP's web-site; and</li>
    <li>all sites currently designated as protected areas, taken from CEP's 		web-site;</li>
</ul>
<p>which are not strictly speaking geographical features, nevertheless are 	felt complementary to the list of toponyms.</p>
<h4>2G. From 2004 and towards 2006<a name="2g"></a></h4>
<p>In 2004 SCAR organised two events: the Open Science Conference in July 	in Bremen and the Delegates Meeting in October at Bremerhaven. The GSSG met 	in July 2004 in the framework of XXVIII SCAR. At the end of the meeting the 	role of Chief Officer passed from Phil O' Brien to Alessandro Capra. Steffen 	Vogt was elected as the Convenor of the Expert Group on Geographic Information (EGGI).</p>
<p>While the next meeting of the SCAR-EGGI is approaching (Hobart, July 2006) it 	is right to consider at this time where we are and where we go with	the CGA.</p>
<p>The continuous effort of keeping and tiding up the Antarctic toponymy 	is now 14 years old and the SCAR gazetteer, is a living body, permanently 	evolving, thus never completed. The CGA is nevertheless widely recognized by the 	scientific community. Most of the geographic names used in Antarctica are already 	in it while newly named features find an international database structured to 	accommodate them.</p>
<p>The CGA is the result of the co-operation of nearly all nations members 	of SCAR and they deserve the merit for the existence of the CGA.</p>
<p>The most needed goal at present is the reconstruction of an Antarctic geographical 	names community, i.e. one person representative per country, in order to establish 	an official interaction with the countries. That will allow to reinvigorate 	the effort of acquiring the (missing) descriptions and the dates of naming for 	all the features already present in the database, apart from the routine action 	of acquiring new approved names.</p>
<p>Looking at more distant future, hopefully the CGA will serve as the basis 	for an internationally agreed toponymy of the continent.</p>
