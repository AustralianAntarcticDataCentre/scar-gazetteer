<h4>4. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CGA<a name="4"></a></h4>
<p>The SCAR Composite Gazetteer of Antarctica contains in form of a database
	all the names that have been published in national gazetteers, plus basic information
	about those names. The 22 countries who contributed data to the project, and
	the content of their national Antarctic gazetteers are listed in Annex E. In
	addition the CGA has incorporated parts of the GEBCO gazetteer, issued by IHO/IOC,
	for under-sea features located south of 60°S.</p>
<p>The overall content of the CGA amounts to 35921 geographic names (1st
	October 2007).</p>
<p><strong>4A. Synonyms</strong><a name="4a"></a><br>
	In addition to the approved names, several national gazetteers list synonyms
		for a given geographic feature; these are commonly labelled as variants in
		the published gazetteers. Synonyms include obsolete (historical) names, mis-spellings
		and incorrect applications but they also include linguistically correct forms
		of geographic names in a foreign language. By including synonyms for a given
		feature, a national gazetteer records the existence of names different from
		the one officially recommended for that feature. A synonym in one country's
		gazetteer can be the approved name in a gazetteer of another country and vice
		versa.</p>
<p>The CGA represents a composite list of approved names taken from all the
	current national gazetteers available. Synonyms in individual gazetteers have
	been excluded since all the names in current usage exist as approved entries
	in other gazetteers. However, it is recognized that the lack of historical names
	and other types of synonyms will limit the value of the CGA when researching
	scientific literature of a historical nature or written in different languages.
	The inclusion of such synonyms may be considered	for a future work.</p>
<p><strong>4B. Geographic coverage and content</strong><a name="4b"></a><br>
	The geographic coverage of the CGA lies south of latitude 60°S. Although
		the interest of SCAR extends North of 60°S and encompasses all the areas inside
		the Antarctic Convergence and also several sub-Antarctic islands, the geographic
		features North of 60°S either fall within the sovereignty of a particular country
		or, in the case of oceanic features, are named according to the rules of international
		bodies. Thus it was agreed in SCAR that the CGA should be limited to the area
		South of 60°S, where as a matter of fact there is no single recognised naming
		authority. Accordingly, those records or sections of national gazetteers which
		refer to areas outside the agreed limit have not been included in the CGA database.
		The present	content of the CGA, on a national basis, is shown in Annex E .</p>
<p><strong>4C. Scientific stations</strong><a name="4c"></a><br>
	There are different national approach about whether Antarctic scientific
		Stations should be included in a list of geographic features or not. Some national
		gazetteers include Antarctic Stations and some do not. A man-made structure
		is not a natural geographic feature but the location of a Station is an important
		piece of geographic information. Because the CGA is just a compilation originating
		from the national gazetteers as published/supplied to Italy (as the Convenor
		of the programme), no Station has been deleted nor was there an attempt to
		obtain a complete list of Stations. As a consequence, some but not all Antarctic
		Stations are listed in the CGA. An updated list of the Antarctic Station, however,
		is permanently available on the Comnap	site.</p>
<p><strong>4D. Word order of entries</strong><a name="4d"></a><br>
	Apart from a few exceptions, a geographical name (toponym) is composed by
		a generic term and by a specific term (see also below, paragraph I ).</p>
<p>In the CGA entries are arranged alphabetically with the specific term
	first. For example, Cape Dalton is listed as &quot;Dalton, Cape&quot;, Mount Dalton as &quot;Dalton, Mount&quot;, Dalton Iceberg Tongue as &quot;Dalton Iceberg Tongue&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>4E. Transliteration</strong><a name="4e"></a><br>
	A characteristic which makes the SCAR CGA a rather singular publication (not
		unique, however) is the diverse origin of the data, derived from different
		languages and alphabets. The transliteration adopted in the SCAR CGA is the
		one provided by the country approving the relevant names. A transliteration
		was needed for Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Bulgarian, and Polish names.</p>
<p><strong>4F. Diacritical marks</strong><a name="4f"></a><br>
	In several languages words are correctly spelled only by making use of diacritical
		marks. To reproduce correctly all diacritical marks used in the national gazetteers
		would be cumbersome. Consequently they have been omitted in the database available
		on the web. However a record is being	kept of all of them.</p>
<p>On the contrary, diacritical mark have been kept in the printed version
	of the CGA. In the publication all diacritical are identical to those present
	in the original gazetteers. Due to the variety of alphabets used in the source-gazetteers,
	the edition of the CGA (printed version) required the use of different fonts
	in order to find all the needed diacritical marks. Under this respect the printed
	version of the CGA is more aligned with the national gazetteers than the database
	available on the web site.</p>
<p><strong>4G. Alphabetical order</strong><a name="4g"></a><br>
	When more entries, corresponding to given query, are sorted out of the database
		they are arranged alphabetically letter-by-letter throughout the name. The
		alphabetical order is set up automatically by the database software, which
		is presently DBASE IV. That means that the blank and the hyphen, when present,
		are regarded as alphabetic characters preceding the letter &quot;A&quot;;
		the comma, when present, is regarded as an alphabetic character following the
		letter &quot;z&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>4H. Basic information</strong><a name="4h"></a><br>
	For each name, CGA contains the following information (not all of them always
		available):</p>
<ul>
	<li> source, i.e. the country which provided the name;</li>
	<li> approval date, when an official approval has been issued by the relevant
		country's organization for geographical names; </li>
	<li> latitude and longitude, with degrees, primes and, when available,
		seconds;</li>
	<li> height above sea level;</li>
	<li> class; and</li>
	<li>reference number. </li>
</ul>
<p> The source refers to the nation publishing the gazetteer from which the
	geographic name has been extracted. A three-letter country ISO code after the
	name, indicates the source of the name. When two or more ISO codes correspond
	to an identical name that indicates that more than one Country has the name
	in its gazetteer. For ISO codes see Annex E .</p>
<p>As to the latitude and longitude it should be noted that the co-ordinates
	supplied by the national gazetteers are usually accurate to a minute of arc.
	However, the accuracy of the values assigned to the co-ordinates varies according
	to the nature of the feature itself and the scale of the map available for identifying
	the feature. Although the accuracy in the location of a nunatak or a cape can
	be within a few metres or tens of metres, the co-ordinates locating the central
	point of a mountain range or an island will be much less accurate, the accuracy
	decreasing as the size of the feature increases. Because no standard algorithms
	are used to calculate the characteristic co-ordinates of an extended feature
	(for example, the central point of the area inside a contour line), different
	gazetteers attribute different pairs of co-ordinates to the same feature, even
	when there is perfect agreement about the feature under consideration and its
	name. The relevance of co-ordinate	accuracy is discussed further in Annex H.</p>
<p>The class indicates the type of geographical feature to which the name
	has been applied. The use of classes, or the classification of names, facilitated
	also the grouping of names applicable to a specific feature (all the names used
	by different countries to indicate the same feature). None of the national Antarctic
	gazetteers includes any reference to classes. The class given in the CGA is
	derived from the generic part of the name (see below) by the Convenor and, more
	rarely, from maps, charts, or additional information supplied as a reply to
	a specific query. For these reasons, the importance attached to the classification
	of the names is to be regarded as practical rather than theoretical. Moreover
	it is quite understandable that the logical border between one class and a similar
	one is somewhat arbitrary. The feature class is coded alpha-numerically. Annex
	F gives the description of the geographic classes to which the features appearing
	in	the CGA have been assigned. The code &quot;na&quot; means that the feature class is not yet assigned.</p>
<p>To each geographic name appearing in the CGA has been given an arbitrary,
	but fixed, reference number or UFI (Unique Feature Identifier). The reference
	number is unique to a specific geographic feature, not to the name itself. Thus
	all names associated with the same reference number refer to the same feature.
	There are many more names than numbered features in Antarctica, indicating that
	there are multiple names for some feature. At present (1st October 2007) 18622
	distinct features are recognized and	included in the CGA.</p>
<p><strong>4I. Generic terms</strong><a name="4i"></a><br>
	The name of a geographic feature is usually made up of two parts which are
		generally called the generic term and the specific term (e.g. the generic part
		or term of Terra Nova Bay is &quot;Bay&quot; and
		the specific part is &quot;Terra Nova&quot;. That is not always true, however. See for instance the toponym &quot;Tour de Pise&quot; or &quot;Three Brothers&quot;.</p>
<p>Although the generic term provides a good indication of the type of feature
	being named, it must be remembered that data in the CGA originated from 23 sources,
	in 12 different languages. A scientist working with the CGA should be familiar
	with the different generic terms and their equivalents in other languages. This
	point is becoming progressively important since the Recommendation SCAR XXIV-5
	which states: &quot;...in adopting existing names, countries are encouraged not to vary any part
	of such names&quot;. Annex G lists all the relevant generic terms that have been incorporated into
	the CGA from the national gazetteers. </p>
